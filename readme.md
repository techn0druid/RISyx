# RISyx

## Project Overview

RISyx (pronounced RYE-SIX) is a lightweight and customizable RISC-V kernel designed for efficiency and flexibility. It aims to provide low-level control over hardware resources while maintaining portability and ease of maintenance.

## Stages of Development

To contribute to RISyx development, follow these steps:

0. **Clone the Repository**: 
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RISyx.git

1. **Set Up Development Environment**: 
- Select, install, and set up a RISC-V toolchain for assembling and compiling code targeting RISC-V architecture.
- Setup emulation environment.

2. **Write Code**:
- Start by writing the startup code in RISC-V assembly language. This code initializes the processor, sets up the environment, and jumps to the main C entry point.
- Implement basic functions such as memory initialization, interrupt handling, and context switching in assembly.
- Write the main kernel logic in C, including scheduler, memory management, file system support (if needed), device drivers, and system calls.

3. **Integration**: 
- Integrate the assembly and C code to create a unified kernel image.
- Set up linker scripts to define memory layout and sections for the kernel image.

4. **Testing**: 
- Test your kernel thoroughly to ensure it boots correctly, handles interrupts, manages memory properly, and performs basic system operations as expected.
- Use emulators, simulators, or hardware (if available) to test your kernel on different RISC-V platforms.

5. **Iterate and Refine**: 
- Iterate on your design, adding features and improving performance and stability.
- Refine your code based on testing feedback and performance analysis.

6. **Contribute**: 
- If you'd like to contribute to RISyx, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Ensure your code follows the project's coding conventions and passes all tests.
